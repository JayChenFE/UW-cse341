    6. Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and  an int n 
        and returns the nth element of the list where the head of the list is 1st.

       Use the operator ^ for concatenating strings 
       and the library function Int.toString for converting an int to a string.
       For producing the month part, do not use a bunch of conditionals.

       and returns an int.
       You should return an int n such that the first n elements of the list add to less than sum,
       but the first n + 1 elements of the list add to sum or more.

    11. Write a function oldest that takes a list of dates and evaluates to an (int*int*int) option. 
        It evaluates to NONE if the list has no dates 
        and SOME d if the date d is the oldest date in the list.

    12. Challenge Problem:
        Write functions number_in_months_challenge and dates_in_months_challenge
        that are like your solutions to problems 3 and 5 
        except having a month in the second argument multiple times 
        has no more effect than having it once. 
        (Hint: Remove duplicates, then use previous work.)
*)

(*
    13. Challenge Problem:
        Write a function reasonable_date that takes a date and determines 
        if it describes a real date in the common era. 
        A "real date" has a positive year (year 0 did not exist), 
                         a  month between 1 and 12, 
                         and a day appropriate for the month. 
        Solutions should properly handle leap years.
        Leap years are years that are either divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.
    (Do not worry about days possibly lost in the conversion to the Gregorian calendar in the Late 1500s.)
